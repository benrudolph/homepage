I'm majoring in Computer Science -- technically my focus is Information Track (whatever that means), but I just took the classes I found interesting and that was the track that I happened to complete. I'm 22 years old and planning on graduating in 2013. My ultimate goal in life (as of now) is to help those in extreme need through the use of technology.<br /><br /> I grew up in Naperville, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Throughout my 18 years there, I built up character walking through the snow one mile uphill (both ways) to get to school.
